# üéÆ StoryCoder - Play & Learn Coding

**Transform children's stories into interactive games that teach programming concepts!** StoryCoder is an educational application that turns simple text stories into playable games while demonstrating fundamental coding concepts in a fun, engaging way.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Story to Game Conversion**: Transform text stories into interactive grid-based games
- **Programming Concepts Learning**: Teaches loops, conditionals, functions, variables, and lists
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Playable game with keyboard controls and sound effects
- **Customization**: Customize game characters and difficulty levels
- **Visual Preview**: See a generated preview of your game
- **Downloadable Code**: Get Python game code to run and modify locally
- **Educational Content**: Learn programming concepts through game examples

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Create a Story**: Write or paste a short story (2-5 sentences)
2. **Generate Game**: The app analyzes your story and creates a game scenario
3. **Play the Game**: Navigate through the grid to collect stars and reach the goal
4. **Learn Concepts**: Understand coding principles used in your game
5. **Get the Code**: Download the Python code to run the game on your computer

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit (Web framework)
- Matplotlib (Visualization)
- NumPy (Numerical operations)
- Pandas (Data handling - if used)
- HTML/CSS (Custom styling)

## üåü Example Stories

Try these sample stories to get started:

1. **Space Explorer**:
   ```
   An astronaut needs to collect 3 stars while avoiding asteroids in space. 
   The stars are scattered across different planets. Each star gives special powers. 
   Collect all stars before returning to Earth.
   ```

2. **Jungle Adventure**:
   ```
   A monkey swings through trees to collect bananas before sunset. 
   There are dangerous snakes and rivers to avoid. Each banana gives energy to jump higher. 
   Collect 10 bananas to win the game!
   ```

3. **Dragon Quest**:
   ```
   A dragon flies through clouds to collect magic crystals. 
   The crystals are guarded by wizards and hidden in castles. 
   Each crystal makes the dragon stronger. 
   Collect 5 crystals to become the dragon king!
   ```
